#Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance the car travels
#down the interstate can be calculated with the following fomula
# Distance = Speed * Time
#A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.
#Write a program that displays the following:
# The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
# The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
# The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

# Assign a value to the speed variable.
speed = 70

# Assign a value to the time variable.
time1 = 6
time2 = 10
time3 = 15

# Get the distance traveled.
distance1 = speed * time1
distance2 = speed * time2
distance3 = speed * time3

print "Traveling at 70 miles per hour..."
print "after 6 hours you will have traveled ", distance1, "miles."
print "after 10 hours you will have traveled ", distance2, "miles."
print "after 15 hours you will have traveled ", distance3, "miles."
